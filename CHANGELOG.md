## 2.0.0 (May 31, 2016)

- Bump CodeMirror version to 5.15.x.
- Ensure `valueUpdated` is in the `actions` queue. This prevents `value` from
  being changed within `didInsertElement`, which would cause Ember to emit a
  deprecation warning.
- Move CodeMirror initialization into a `code-mirror` service.
- Following DDAU (Data Down, Actions Up), `ivy-codemirror` no longer sets its
  `value` property directly. Instead, it sends the `valueUpdated` action and
  expects the caller to handle changing the value.
- Update value via `didRender` rather than observers.
- Change how options are specified. Instead of setting individual options, such
  as `autofocus`, `mode`, etc., `ivy-codemirror` now accepts an `options`
  property, which is expected to be a hash of options.
